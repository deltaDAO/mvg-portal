### Table of contents

## 1. What are cookies?

A cookie is a small file that stores information on your device. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either:

- sent back to the website that created it (**first-party cookie**), or
- sent to another website it belongs to (**third-party cookie**).

This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content.

**Web storage** (local storage and session storage) has similar functionality to cookies. In the following, the term “cookies” refers to **both**, web storage and regular cookies.

**Cookie categories**

There are several categories of cookies including the following cookie categories.

- **Essential cookies**: These cookies are strictly necessary for you to browse a website and use its features.
- **Preference cookies**: Preference cookies are not absolutely necessary for the technical operation of a website but increase user-friendliness.
- **Statistics cookies**: Statistics cookies or performance cookies collect information about how you use a website, e.g., which pages you visited, to improve website functions. The information is aggregated and not used to identify you.
- **Marketing cookies**: Marketing cookies track your activity to deliver relevant advertising or to limit the number of times you see an ad. That information can be shared with other organizations or advertisers.
