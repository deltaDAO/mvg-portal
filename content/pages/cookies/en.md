### Table of contents

## 1. What are cookies?

A cookie is a small file that stores information on your device. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either:

- sent back to the website that created it (**first-party cookie**), or
- sent to another website it belongs to (**third-party cookie**).

This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content.

**Web storage** (local storage and session storage) has similar functionality to cookies. In the following, the term “cookies” refers to **both**, web storage and regular cookies.

## 2. How do we use cookies?
