## 2. Registration, Access to and Use of the Data Portal

**2.1** The use of the Data Portal requires the registration of the Customer. The Customer shall complete the accreditation process and provide all specified information and documents. The Customer confirms their offer to consume or publish Service Offerings via the Data Portal by actively selecting the respective Terms and Conditions checkbox and thereby accepting this Terms. Upon acceptance of this Terms by the Customer an Agreement is concluded which entitles the Customer to the Consumption and Publication of Service Offering on the Data Portal. The Customer waives the receipt of the acceptance declaration pursuant to section 151 German Civil Code.

**2.2** The Customer can access and use the Data Portal in accordance with the Agreement. The Customer undertakes to comply with this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations as well as Policies applicable to Customer’s use of the Data Portal.

**2.3** The Data Portal provides a portal enabling Customers to access and utilise Service Offerings. Publishers can publish Service Offerings on the portal by using the form provided by deltaDAO and then clicking the “SUBMIT” button. The Publisher is responsible for the information provided in the form which describes the Service Offering and for the content of the Service Offering. When publishing the Service offering, a Service Offering Token will be created via the respective EVM Compatible Blockchain. The Service Offering Token manages access rights to the respective Service Offering and enables Data Buyers to interact directly with Publishers.

**2.4** The Data Portal displays published Service Offerings including their description and enables Customers to discover Service Offerings by means of a query mechanism.

**2.5** The Data Portal further enables the Consumption of Service Offerings by acquiring the respective Service Offering Token via the respective EVM Compatible Blockchain and hence access to the Service Offering.

**2.6** The Customer is responsible for its own activity on the Data Portal. The Customer must adhere to the laws in its own legal jurisdiction as well as their conscience. deltaDAO is not responsible for any malicious use of the Data Portal or any losses associated with the use of the Data Portal of any source. Some layers in Data ecosystems also accessible via the Data Portal may require the Customer to create and keep up to date verified credentials.

## 3. Customer’s Responsibilities

**3.1** The Customer is responsible for all activities undertaken from its Customer Account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by the Customer or undertaken by the Customer, the Customer’s employees or a third party (including the Customer’s contractors and agents). deltaDAO and its affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Customer Account. The Customer will be deemed to have taken any action relating to its Customer Account.

**3.2** The Customer will ensure that published Service Offerings and the Customer’s use of Service Offerings or the Data Portal will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law. The Customer is solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, availability, and use of published Service Offerings. The Publisher is also solely responsible for ensuring that the content of the metadata provided via the description form complies with applicable law. **The Customer will not provide Personal Data in the metadata and Service Offering.**

**3.3** The Customer will ensure that all third parties comply with its obligations according to this Agreement, mirroring those of the Customer under the Agreement and that the terms of any Customer’s agreements with third parties are consistent with this Agreement. If the Customer becomes aware of any violation of Customer’s obligations under this Agreement caused by a third party, the Customer will immediately suspend access to published Service Offerings and the Data Portal by such third party. deltaDAO does not provide any support or services to third parties, unless deltaDAO has a separate agreement with the Customer or a third party obligating deltaDAO to provide such support or services.

**3.4** deltaDAO does not store or has access to any sensitive account information including keys. The Customer is responsible for the availability and maintenance of any information related to the Customer Account.

## 4. Fees and Payment

**4.1** If a Customer elects to publish or consume Service Offerings on the Data Portal, which includes the generation and purchase of the respective Service Offering Token, it will be conducted solely through EVM Compatible Blockchains via compatible Web3 wallets. deltaDAO will have no insight into or control over these activities, nor does deltaDAO have the ability to reverse any of these or any transaction resulting therefrom.

**4.2** EVM Compatible Blockchains may require the payment of a Gas Fee for every transaction occurring. The Gas Fee typically funds the network of computers that run the EVM Compatible Blockchains. This means that the Customer will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Data Portal and transacting via the Data Portal will require an accordingly funded wallet.

**4.3** Each Party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that Party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement.

## 5. Suspension

**5.1** deltaDAO may suspend all or parts of the Customer's or any third party's right to access or use any component or all of the Data Portal immediately with no prior notice to the Customer if deltaDAO determines that the Customer or a third party’s use of the Data Portal:

**_5.1.1_** poses a security risk to the Data Portal or any other third party;

**_5.1.2_** could adversely impact deltaDAO`s systems, the Data Portal or the systems or content of any other deltaDAO user;

**_5.1.3_** could subject deltaDAO, deltaDAO`s affiliates, or any third party to liability, and/or

**_5.1.4_** could be fraudulent;

**_5.1.5_** Customer or any of its customers is in breach of essential obligations of this Agreement; or

**_5.1.6_** Customer has ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of Customer assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.

**5.2** If deltaDAO, according to Section 5.1, suspends Customer’s right to access or use any component or all of the Data Portal:

**_5.2.1_** the Customer remains responsible for all fees and charges the Customer incurs during the period of suspension; and

**_5.2.2_** the Customer will not be entitled to any service credits relating to the provision of the Services for any period of suspension.

## 6. Service Lifecycle Management

Service Offerings are subject to Service Lifecycle Management. Service Offerings on the Data Portal are characterised with a Lifecycle State pursuant to the categories: "active", "end-of-life", "deprecated" "revoked", “disabled”, and “unlisted”. The default state of any Service Offering upon initial publication is "active". The Lifecycle States "end-of-live", "deprecated" and "revoked" are terminal, i.e., no further Lifecycle State transitions follow upon them. Being in a Lifecycle State has implications on how the Service Offering is displayed in the Data Portal, and what actions are permitted to be performed with regard to the Service Offering. The assignment and transition of one Lifecycle State to another is subject to the respective Policy. Customers are bound by the Policy regarding assignment and transition of a Lifecycle State.

## 7. Security and Data Protection

**7.1** Without limiting the Customer’s obligations under Section 3.2, deltaDAO will implement reasonable and appropriate measures regarding the Access Controller to help the Customer secure published Data against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.

**7.2** Data is always stored off-chain. deltaDAO has no control over this Data. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Data is in the sole responsibility of the Customer. Only metadata relating to Data is stored on-chain. To provide for the functionality of the Data Portal deltaDAO saves on-chain Data in a custom database. **Metadata and Service Offerings must not contain Personal Data**.

**7.3** Transactions that take place via the Data Portal are managed and confirmed via the respective EVM Compatible Blockchain. The **Customer’s public key on such EVM Compatible Blockchain is publicly visible** whenever the Customer engages in a transaction on the Data Portal.

**7.4** deltaDAO neither owns nor controls the EVM Compatible Blockchains, any Customer's Web3 wallets, nor other tools, or any other third parties’ site, product, or service that the Customer might access, visit, or use when interacting via the Data Portal. deltaDAO will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will deltaDAO be liable for any damage that the Customer may suffer as a result of transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

**7.5** The security of the Customer's data is important to deltaDAO, but the Customer is aware that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While deltaDAO strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect the Customer's Personal Data, deltaDAO cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 8. Term and Termination

**8.1** This Agreement is concluded for an unlimited term.

**8.2** This Agreement can be terminated by either party upon one months' notice to the end of any month.

**8.3** Each party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for good cause without the need to adhere to a notice period. Good cause for deltaDAO shall, in particular, include the following: (a) breach of essential obligations of the Agreement by the Customer (b) tortious acts by a Customer or the attempt of any such act, e.g. fraud; circumstances pursuant to section 5.1 relating to the Customer.

**8.4** All notices of termination must be given in writing. Termination notice by e-mail is deemed to comport with the written form requirement.

**8.5** In case of termination, the access to the Data Portal, including the ability to publish, consume, or access consumed Service Offerings on the Data Portal, will be suspended. deltaDAO will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension.
