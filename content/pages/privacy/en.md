>
> **6.7** The Portal User is responsible for its own activity on the Data Portal. The Portal User must adhere to the laws in its own legal jurisdiction as well as its conscience. Portal Operator is not responsible for any malicious use of the Data Portal or any losses associated with the use of the Data Portal of any source.

#### 3. Service Offering Lifecycle states

Service Offerings and Portal User Accounts are subject to the Service Lifecycle Management (SLM), a mechanism to deactivate Portal User Accounts and change the visibility and _consumability_ of any Service Offering from the Data Portal depending on the Lifecycle State. Being in a Lifecycle State has implications on how the Service Offering is displayed in the Data Portal, and what actions are permitted to be performed regarding the Service Offering or by the Portal User Account.

##### 3.1 Set by the Data Publisher

Lifecycle State means the following properties of metadata describing the state of Service Offerings _and Portal User Accounts_ throughout their lifecycle. The Lifecycle State is set by the Data Publisher.

> **Active.**
>
> > The default state upon initial publication. Service Offerings in the "Active" state are fully functional and available for discovery in Data Portal. Data Portal Users can search for, view, and interact with these Service Offerings. Data consumption is allowed.
>
> **End-of-Life.**
>
> > A terminal state after a timeout date. Service Offerings remain discoverable but cannot be consumed by Data Portal Users.
>
> **Deprecated.**
>
> > A terminal state describing a Service Offering superseded by another Service Offering. Deprecated Service Offerings are not discoverable, and consumption is not allowed.
>
> **Revoked.**
>
> > A terminal state describing a Service Offering which has been revoked by the Data Publisher, e.g., because it contained wrong or fraudulent information. Revoked Service Offerings are not discoverable, and consumption is not allowed.
>
> **Consumption is temporary disabled.**
>
> > A non-terminal state describing a Service Offering which cannot be consumed at the moment. It is still discoverable.
>
> **Unlisted.**
>
> > A non-terminal state describing a Service Offering which is not visible on the Data Portal but can still be consumed.

The Lifecycle States set by the Data Publisher have the following properties:

| **Lifecycle state**                   | **Discoverable on Data Portal** | **Consumption allowed** | **Listed under account** |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Active**                            | Yes                             | Yes                     | Yes                      |
| **End-of-life**                       | No                              | No                      | No                       |
| **Deprecated**                        | No                              | No                      | No                       |
| **Revoked**                           | No                              | No                      | No                       |
| **Consumption is temporary disabled** | Yes                             | No                      | Yes                      |
| **Unlisted**                          | No                              | Yes                     | Yes                      |

##### 3.2 Set by the Portal Operator

Being in a Lifecycle State set by the Portal Operator has implications on how the Service Offering is _displayed_ in the Data Portal, and what actions are permitted to be performed on the Data Portal regarding the Service Offering or by the Portal User Account.

| :------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Listed**          | Yes                             | Yes                                    | Yes                      |
| **Unlisted**        | No                              | No                                     | Yes                      |
