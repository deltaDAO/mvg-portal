      "As public institutions increasingly digitize and share records online, and as more digital-born records become accessible, the risk of using AI, including exposing sensitive personal data, has grown significantly.",
      "ClioX addresses these risks by allowing archives to manage consent and usage rights for their data while ensuring that computations are performed where the data is stored. This means that the raw data is never moved or exposed; only the results or insights from the computations are shared.",
      "The platform also provides AI + visual analytic tools to help researchers analyze large volumes of archival data and discover new insights among them."

Think of it like the difference between renting a house (Web2) and owning it (Web3). While Web2 platforms control your data and content, Web3 gives you the keys to your digital life—offering more privacy, transparency, and autonomy online."
