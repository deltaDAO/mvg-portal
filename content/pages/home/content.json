[Ocean Enterprise](https://www.oceanenterprise.io/) is a fully open-source technology stack, leveraging DLT and decentralization, aiming to give control back to the owners of data services. Pontus-X is built on top of [Oasis Network](https://oasisprotocol.org/) showcasing how future industrial digital service ecosystems work today.",

Compute-to-Data is the functionality that solves the current trade-off between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. It allows data consumers to run compute jobs on private data while the data stays on-premise with the data provider.",
